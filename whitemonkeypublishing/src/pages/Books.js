        Focusing on source criticism the educational book: Is that really how it is? Teaches the
        importance of finding and evaluating the sources behind facts you might take as a
        given. The book gives examples from history, about urban myths, animal care and some
        scary facts to illustrate how what we perceive as truth may actually be wrong.
        Students are encouraged to find the sources behind the facts in the book themselves,
        and to investigate facts of their own as another assignment.
